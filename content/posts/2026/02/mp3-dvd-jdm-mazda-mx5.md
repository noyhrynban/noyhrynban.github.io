I wanted some of my music to always be in my car so that I don't have to always have my phone connected or worry about finding a radio station that's playing something I want to hear. Sometimes, I don't feel like connecting CarPlay to drive down to the gas station. I know, first-world problems.

My JDM 2020 MX-5 RF has a DVD-capable player. I know from previous experience that the CD player in a US 2015 MX-5 would play MP3 CDs, so I wondered if that same DVD drive in my JDM ND2 would play an MP3 DVD and give me quite a bit more capacity on a single disc.

The manual was pretty useless. It only spoke of the DVD drive from the perspective of watching DVDs (when the car is parked, for safety, of course). MP3 CDs were admittedly not very popular, so it is little surprise that the manual only spoke of putting MP3s on a USB drive or on a CD or played through an iPod/phone/etc.

After some looking, I saw something about how all of the optical formats are some kind of ISO standard and essentially as long as the drive can read the media, and the filesystem on the disc is an ISO filesystem, the player shouldn't care if the disc was CD or DVD and it should just recognize the DVD of MP3 files like a very large CD of MP3 files.

I gave it a go and dug out an old spindle of DVD-R media and burned a DVD full of Lo-Fi MP3s and lo and behold it plays! I don't see any album art, but those could merely be missing from the files; I didn't check. It doesn't matter because now I can always rely on having some very pleasant Lo-Fi in the car no matter what.

Next time I'll use a dual-layer DVD for double the fun.
